# RToolBox

A personal collection of convenience functions for styling data displays and outputs, transforming and organizing data, performing statistical analyses, and other commonly performed actions in data science projects.

The package can be installed using the following syntax:
```r
devtools::install_github("zwallen/RToolBox")
```

As these are only personal covenience functions wrapping existing functions and packages:
* They may or may not work for your purposes as they were designed in response to specific workflows and analyses. They are not meant to be designed for general audience use.
* Citation of the package is not necessary if you decide to use any of the functions written here (but glad if they were able to help!).
